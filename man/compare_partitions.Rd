\value{
Each cluster validity measure is a single numeric value.

\code{normalized_confusion_matrix()} returns a numeric matrix.

\code{normalizing_permutation()} returns a vector of indexes.
}
\description{
The functions described in this section quantify the similarity between
two label vectors \code{x} and \code{y} which represent two partitions
of a set of \eqn{n} elements into, respectively, \eqn{K} and \eqn{L}
nonempty and pairwise disjoint subsets.

For instance, \code{x} and \code{y} can represent two clusterings
of a dataset with \eqn{n} observations specified by two vectors
of labels. The functions described here can be used as external cluster
validity measures, where we assume that \code{x} is
a reference (ground-truth) partition whilst \code{y} is the vector
of predicted cluster memberships.

All indices except \code{normalized_clustering_accuracy()}
can act as a pairwise partition similarity score: they are symmetric,
i.e., \code{index(x, y) == index(y, x)}.

Each index except \code{mi_score()} (which computes the mutual
information score) outputs 1 given two identical partitions.
Note that partitions are always defined up to a permutation (bijection)
of the set of possible labels, e.g., (1, 1, 2, 1) and (4, 4, 2, 4)
represent the same 2-partition.

\details{
\code{normalized_clustering_accuracy()} (Gagolewski, 2023)
is an asymmetric external cluster validity measure
which assumes that the label vector \code{x} (or rows in the confusion
matrix) represents the reference (ground truth) partition.
It is an average proportion of correctly classified points in each cluster
above the worst case scenario of uniform membership assignment,
with cluster ID matching based on the solution to the maximal linear
sum assignment problem; see \code{\link{normalized_confusion_matrix}}).
It is given by:
\eqn{\max_\sigma \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^K \frac{c_{\sigma(j), j}-c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}/K}{c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}-c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}/K}},
where \eqn{C} is a confusion matrix with \eqn{K} rows and \eqn{L} columns,
\eqn{\sigma} is a permutation of the set \eqn{\{1,\dots,\max(K,L)\}}, and
\eqn{c_{i, \cdot}=c_{i, 1}+...+c_{i, L}} is the i-th row sum,
under the assumption that \eqn{c_{i,j}=0} for \eqn{i>K} or \eqn{j>L}
and \eqn{0/0=0}.

\code{normalized_pivoted_accuracy()} is defined as
\eqn{(\max_\sigma \sum_{j=1}^{\max(K,L)} c_{\sigma(j),j}/n-1/\max(K,L))/(1-1/\max(K,L))},
where \eqn{\sigma} is a permutation of the set \eqn{\{1,\dots,\max(K,L)\}},
and \eqn{n} is the sum of all elements in \eqn{C}.
For non-square matrices, missing rows/columns are assumed
to be filled with 0s.

\code{pair_sets_index()} (PSI) was introduced in (Rezaei, Franti, 2016).
The simplified PSI assumes E=1 in the definition of the index,
i.e., uses Eq. (20) in the said paper instead of Eq. (18).
For non-square matrices, missing rows/columns are assumed
to be filled with 0s.

\code{rand_score()} gives the Rand score (the "probability" of agreement
between the two partitions) and
\code{adjusted_rand_score()} is its version corrected for chance,
see (Hubert, Arabie, 1985): its expected value is 0 given two independent
partitions. Due to the adjustment, the resulting index may be negative
for some inputs.

Similarly, \code{fm_score()} gives the Fowlkes-Mallows (FM) score
and \code{adjusted_fm_score()} is its adjusted-for-chance version;
see (Hubert, Arabie, 1985).

\code{mi_score()}, \code{adjusted_mi_score()} and
\code{normalized_mi_score()} are information-theoretic
scores, based on mutual information,
see the definition of \eqn{AMI_{sum}} and \eqn{NMI_{sum}}
in (Vinh et al., 2010).


\code{normalized_confusion_matrix()} computes the confusion matrix
and permutes its rows and columns so that the sum of the elements
of the main diagonal is the largest possible (by solving
the maximal assignment problem).
The function only accepts \eqn{K \leq L}.
The reordering of the columns of a confusion matrix can be determined
by calling \code{normalizing_permutation()}.

Also note that the built-in
\code{\link{table}()} determines the standard confusion matrix.
