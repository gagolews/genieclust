# compare_partitions: External Cluster Validity Measures and Pairwise Partition Similarity Scores

## Description

The functions described in this section quantify the similarity between two label vectors `x` and `y` which represent two partitions of a set of $n$ elements into, respectively, $K$ and $L$ nonempty and pairwise disjoint subsets; for a review, refer to the paper by Gagolewski (2025).

For instance, `x` and `y` can represent two clusterings of a dataset with $n$ observations specified by two vectors of labels. The functions described here can be used as external cluster validity measures, where we assume that `x` is a reference (ground-truth) partition whilst `y` is the vector of predicted cluster memberships.

All indices except `normalized_clustering_accuracy()` can act as a pairwise partition similarity score: they are symmetric, i.e., `index(x, y) == index(y, x)`.

Each index except `mi_score()` (which computes the mutual information score) outputs 1 given two identical partitions. Note that partitions are always defined up to a permutation (bijection) of the set of possible labels, e.g., (1, 1, 2, 1) and (4, 4, 2, 4) represent the same 2-partition.

## Usage

``` r
normalized_clustering_accuracy(x, y = NULL)

normalized_pivoted_accuracy(x, y = NULL)

pair_sets_index(x, y = NULL, simplified = FALSE, clipped = TRUE)

adjusted_rand_score(x, y = NULL, clipped = FALSE)

rand_score(x, y = NULL)

adjusted_fm_score(x, y = NULL, clipped = FALSE)

fm_score(x, y = NULL)

mi_score(x, y = NULL)

normalized_mi_score(x, y = NULL)

adjusted_mi_score(x, y = NULL, clipped = FALSE)

normalized_confusion_matrix(x, y = NULL)

normalizing_permutation(x, y = NULL)
```

## Arguments

|  |  |
|----|----|
| `x` | an integer vector of length n (or an object coercible to) representing a K-partition of an n-set (e.g., a reference partition), or a confusion matrix with K rows and L columns (see [`table(x, y)`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/table.html)) |
| `y` | an integer vector of length n (or an object coercible to) representing an L-partition of the same set (e.g., the output of a clustering algorithm we wish to compare with `x`), or NULL (if x is an $K\times L$ confusion matrix) |
| `simplified` | whether to assume E=1 in the definition of the pair sets index index, i.e., use Eq. (20) in (Rezaei, Franti, 2016) instead of Eq. (18) |
| `clipped` | whether the result should be clipped to the unit interval, i.e., \[0, 1\] |

## Details

`normalized_clustering_accuracy()` is an asymmetric external cluster validity measure proposed by Gagolewski (2025). It assumes that the label vector `x` (or rows in the confusion matrix) represents the reference (ground truth) partition. It is the average proportion of correctly classified points in each cluster above the worst case scenario representing the uniform membership assignment, with the cluster ID matching based on the solution to the maximal linear sum assignment problem; see [`normalized_confusion_matrix`](compare_partitions.md)). The index is given by: $\max_\sigma \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^K \frac{c_{\sigma(j), j}-c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}/K}{c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}-c_{\sigma(j),\cdot}/K}$, where $C$ is a confusion matrix with $K$ rows and $L$ columns, $\sigma$ is a permutation of the set $\{1,\dots,\max(K,L)\}$, and $c_{i, \cdot}=c_{i, 1}+...+c_{i, L}$ is the i-th row sum, under the assumption that $c_{i,j}=0$ for $i>K$ or $j>L$ and $0/0=0$.

`normalized_pivoted_accuracy()` is defined as $(\max_\sigma \sum_{j=1}^{\max(K,L)} \frac{c_{\sigma(j),j}/n-1/\max(K,L)}{1-1/\max(K,L)}$, where $\sigma$ is a permutation of the set $\{1,\dots,\max(K,L)\}$, and $n$ is the sum of all elements in $C$. For non-square matrices, missing rows/columns are assumed to be filled with 0s.

`pair_sets_index()` (PSI) was introduced by Rezaei and Franti (2016). The simplified PSI assumes E=1 in the definition of the index, i.e., uses Eq. (20) in the said paper instead of Eq. (18). For non-square matrices, missing rows/columns are assumed to be filled with 0s.

`rand_score()` gives the Rand score (the \"probability\" of agreement between the two partitions) and `adjusted_rand_score()` is its version corrected for chance (see Hubert, Arabie, 1985): its expected value is 0 given two independent partitions. Due to the adjustment, the resulting index may be negative for some inputs.

Similarly, `fm_score()` gives the Fowlkes-Mallows (FM) score and `adjusted_fm_score()` is its adjusted-for-chance version; (see Hubert, Arabie, 1985).

`mi_score()`, `adjusted_mi_score()` and `normalized_mi_score()` are information-theoretic scores, based on mutual information, see the definition of $AMI_{sum}$ and $NMI_{sum}$ in the paper by Vinh et al. (2010).

`normalized_confusion_matrix()` computes the confusion matrix and permutes its rows and columns so that the sum of the elements of the main diagonal is the largest possible (by solving the maximal assignment problem). The function only accepts $K \leq L$. The reordering of the columns of a confusion matrix can be determined by calling `normalizing_permutation()`.

Also note that the built-in [`table()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/table.html) function determines the standard confusion matrix.

## Value

Each cluster validity measure is a single numeric value.

`normalized_confusion_matrix()` returns a numeric matrix.

`normalizing_permutation()` returns a vector of indexes.
