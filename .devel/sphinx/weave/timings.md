# Timings (How Fast Is It?)

::::{note}
This section needs to be updated for the new release of *genieclust* ≥ 1.2.0.
::::

In the [previous section](benchmarks_ar), we have demonstrated
that Genie often generates partitions of decent *quality*. However, is it quick?
Let's compare it against K-means from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
{cite}`sklearn` version 0.23.1
(`sklearn.cluster.KMeans`) for different number of threads
(by default, it uses all available resources;
note that the number of restarts, `n_init`, defaults to 10)
and hierarchical agglomerative algorithms
with the centroid, median, and Ward linkage implemented in the
[fastcluster](http://www.danifold.net/fastcluster.html) package
{cite}`fastclusterpkg`.



Genie, just like the single linkage, is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST)
{cite}`cvimst` of the pairwise distance graph of an input point set.
Given the MST (the slow part), Genie itself has $O(n \sqrt{n})$ time
and $O(n)$ memory complexity.
Generally, our parallelised implementation of a Jarník (Prim/Dijkstra)-like
method {cite}`olson` will be called to compute an MST, which takes $O(d n^2)$ time.
However, [mlpack.emst](https://www.mlpack.org/) {cite}`mlpack` provides a very fast
alternative in the case of Euclidean spaces of (very) low dimensionality,
see {cite}`emst` and the `mlpack_enabled` parameter, which is automatically used
for datasets with up to $d=6$ features.
Moreover, in the approximate method (`exact=False`), we apply
the Kruskal algorithm on the near-neighbour graph determined
by `nmslib` {cite}`nmslib`. Even though this only gives *some* sort of a spanning *forest*,
such a data structure [turns out to be very suitable for our clustering task](benchmarks_approx).

All timings will be performed on a PC running GNU/Linux 5.4.0-40-generic #44-Ubuntu
SMP x86_64 kernel with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz (12M cache, 6 cores, 12 threads)
and total memory of 16,242,084 kB.







## Large Datasets


Let's study the algorithm's run times for some of the
"larger" datasets (70,000-105,600 observations,
see section on [benchmark results](benchmarks_ar) for discussion)
from the
[Benchmark Suite for Clustering Algorithms (Version 1.0)](https://clustering-benchmarks.gagolewski.com),
{cite}`clustering-benchmarks`.
Features with variance of 0 were removed,
datasets were centred at **0** and scaled so that they have total variance of 1.
Tiny bit of Gaussian noise was added to each observation.
Clustering is performed with respect to the Euclidean distance.








Here are the results (in seconds) if 6 threads are requested
(except for `fastcluster` which is not parallelised).
For K-means, the timings are listed as a function of the number of clusters to detect,
for the other hierarchical methods the run-times are almost identical irrespective of the
partitions' cardinality.

Of course, the K-means algorithm is the fastest.
However, its performance degrades as K increases. Hence, it might not be
a good choice for the so-called *extreme clustering* (compare {cite}`extreme`)
problems. Most importantly, the approximate version of Genie (based on `nmslib`)
is only slightly slower.
The exact variant is extremely performant in Euclidean spaces of low dimensionality
(thanks to `mlpack`) and overall at least 10 times more efficient than the other
hierarchical algorithms in this study.





## Timings as a Function of `n` and `d`

In order to study the run-times as a function dataset size and dimensionality,
let's consider a series of synthetic benchmarks, each with two Gaussian blobs of size `n/2`
(with i.i.d. coordinates), in a `d`-dimensional space.

Here are the medians of 3–10 timings (depending on the dataset size), in seconds,
on 6 threads:

| method             |   d |   10000 |   50000 |   100000 |   500000 |   1000000 |

By default, `mlpack_enabled` is `"auto"`, which translates
to `True` if the requested metric is Euclidean,  Python package `mlpack` is available,
and `d` is not greater than 6.
The effect of the curse of dimensionality is clearly visible -- clustering
in very low-dimensional Euclidean spaces is extremely fast.
On the other hand, the approximate version of Genie can easily cluster
very large datasets. Only the system's memory limits might become a problem then.

## Timings as a Function of the Number of Threads

Recall that the timings are done on a PC with 6 physical cores.
Genie turns out to be nicely parallelisable, as seen on the `mnist/digits` dataset:

## Summary

The approximate (`exact=False`) version of Genie is much faster
than the original one. At the same time, it is still
[highly compatible](benchmarks_approx) with it
(at least at higher levels of the cluster hierarchy). Therefore, we
can safely recommend its use in large problem instances.
Most importantly, its performance is not much worse than the K-means method
with small K. Once a complete cluster hierarchy is determined,
partitioning of any cardinality can be extracted in less than 0.34s on a 1M dataset.
Still, even the exact Genie is amongst the fastest clustering algorithms in the pool.

On top of that, we are also allowed to change our mind about the `gini_threshold`
parameter once the clustering is has been determined. The MST is stored for further
reference and is not recomputed unless needed. Here are the timings for
a first run of the algorithm:


``` python
import time, genieclust, numpy as np
X = np.loadtxt("worms_2.data.gz", ndmin=2)
g = genieclust.Genie(n_clusters=2, gini_threshold=0.3)
t0 = time.time()
g.fit(X)
print("time elapsed - first run: %.3f" % (time.time()-t0))
## Genie()
## time elapsed - first run: 0.119
```


Changing some parameters and re-running the cluster search:


``` python
g.set_params(n_clusters=10)
g.set_params(gini_threshold=0.1)
t0 = time.time()
g.fit(X)
print("time elapsed - consecutive run: %.3f" % (time.time()-t0))
## Genie(n_clusters=10)
## Genie(gini_threshold=0.1, n_clusters=10)
## Genie(gini_threshold=0.1, n_clusters=10)
## time elapsed - consecutive run: 0.026
```
