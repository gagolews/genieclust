# What Is New in *genieclust*


## 1.1.x (under development)

-  [GENERAL] ..TO DO.. We now mention that the partition similarity scores
   are discussed in more detail at
   <https://clustering-benchmarks.gagolewski.com>.

-  [Python and R] Implementations of the so-called internal cluster
   validity measures discussed in
   DOI:[10.1016/j.ins.2021.10.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2021.10.004);
   see our (GitHub-only) [CVI](https://github.com/gagolews/optim_cvi) package
   for R. In particular, the generalised Dunn indices are based on the code
   originally authored by Maciej Bartoszuk. Thanks.

   Functions added (to the `cluster_validity` module in the Python version):
   `calinski_harabasz_index`,
   `dunnowa_index`,
   `generalised_dunn_index`,
   `negated_ball_hall_index`,
   `negated_davies_bouldin_index`,
   `negated_wcss_index`,
   `silhouette_index`,
   `silhouette_w_index`,
   `wcnn_index`.

-  [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] `compare_partitions.normalized_confusion_matrix`
   now solves the maximal assignment problem instead of applying
   the primitive partial pivoting.

-  [Python and R] TODO: ... New function: `normalize_cluster_ids`.

-  [R] New function: `normalized_confusion_matrix`.


## 1.0.1 (2022-08-08)

-  [GENERAL] A paper on the `genieclust` package is now available:
   M. Gagolewski, genieclust: Fast and robust hierarchical clustering,
   *SoftwareX* **15**, 100722, 2021, DOI:
   [10.1016/j.softx.2021.100722](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2021.100722).

-  [Python] `plots.plot_scatter` now uses a more accessible default palette
   (from R 4.0.0).

-  [Python] New function: `inequity.devergottini_index`.

-  [R] New function: `devergottini_index`.


## 1.0.0 (2021-04-22)

-  [R] Use `mlpack` instead of `RcppMLPACK` (#72).
   This package is merely suggested, not dependent upon.


## 0.9.8 (2021-01-08)

-  [Python] Require Python >= 3.7 (implied by `numpy`).

-  [Python] Require `nmslib`.

-  [R] Use `RcppMLPACK` directly; remove dependency on `emstreeR`.

-  [R] Use `tinytest` for unit testing instead of `testthat`.


## 0.9.4 (2020-07-31)

-  [BUGFIX] [R] Fix build errors on Solaris.


## 0.9.3 (2020-07-25)

-  [BUGFIX] [Python] Add code coverage CI. Fix some minor inconsistencies.
   Automate the `bdist` build chain.

-  [R] Update DESCRIPTION to meet the CRAN policies.


## 0.9.2 (2020-07-22)

-  [BUGFIX] [Python] Fix broken build script for OS X with no OpenMP.


## 0.9.1 (2020-07-18)

-  [GENERAL] The package has been completely rewritten.
   The core functionality is now implemented in C++ (with OpenMP).

-  [GENERAL] Clustering with respect to HDBSCAN*-like
   mutual reachability distances is supported.

-  [GENERAL] The parallelised Jarnik-Prim algorithm now supports on-the-fly
   distance computations. Euclidean minimum spanning tree can be
   determined with `mlpack`, which is much faster in low-dimensional spaces.

-  [R] R version is now available.

-  [Python] [Experimental] The GIc algorithm proposed by Anna Cena
   in her 2018 PhD thesis is added.

-  [Python] Approximate version based on nearest neighbour graphs produced
   by `nmslib` is added.


## 0.1a2 (2018-05-23)

-  [Python] Initial PyPI release.
