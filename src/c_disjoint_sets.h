/*! Disjoint Sets (Union-Find) Data Structure
 *
 *   A class to represent partitions of the set {0,1,...,n-1} for any n.
 *
 *   Path compression for find() is implemented,
 *   but the union() operation is naive (neither
 *   it is union by rank nor by size),
 *   see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure.
 *   This is by design, as some other operations in the current
 *   package rely on the assumption that the parent id of each
 *   element is always <= than itself.
