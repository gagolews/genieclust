Description: A retake on the Genie algorithm
    (Gagolewski, 2021 <DOI:10.1016/j.softx.2021.100722>), which is a robust
    hierarchical clustering method
    (Gagolewski, Bartoszuk, Cena, 2016 <DOI:10.1016/j.ins.2016.05.003>).
    It is now faster and more memory efficient; determining the whole cluster
    hierarchy for datasets of 10M points in low dimensional Euclidean spaces or
    100K points in high-dimensional ones takes only a minute or so.
    Allows clustering with respect to mutual reachability distances
    so that it can act as a noise point detector or a robustified version of
    'HDBSCAN*' (that is able to detect a predefined number of
    clusters and hence it does not dependent on the somewhat
    fragile 'eps' parameter). The package also features an implementation
    of inequality indices (e.g., Gini and Bonferroni),
    external cluster validity measures (e.g., the normalised clustering accuracy,
    the adjusted Rand index, the Fowlkes-Mallows index, and
    normalised mutual information), and internal cluster validity indices
    (e.g., the Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, Ball-Hall, Silhouette,
    and generalised Dunn indices).
    See also the 'Python' version of 'genieclust' available on 'PyPI', which
    supports sparse data, more metrics, and even larger datasets.
